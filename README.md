- 👋 Hi, I’m @KatieNKali.  This collection of code represents me on my self-taught journey into programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in building myself and my skills, connecting with other programmers of all backgrounds, helping others get into code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, and any other language I can get my hands on!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rails applications, online exercises, and self development.
